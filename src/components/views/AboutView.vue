    <h1>What <i>is</i> this tool?</h1>
    <p>
      This site was created to be a simple, easy to use resource in a moment of emotional turmoil. It's based on DBT skills for emotion regulation.
      It's meant to be used
      <i>in the moment</i>, as a way to help change your emotional response to a given situation. Each 'solution'
      gives you a body language adjustment, a breathing exercise and an opposite emotion / reaction tip. It should only
      take a couple of minutes to follow the provided 'solution' and take back control of your emotional state. The more you practice
      these strategies, the easier and more second nature it will become to keep control of your emotions in tough situations
    </p>
     <h1>What <i>isn't</i> this tool?</h1>
    <p>
      This site is not medical advice. It isn't written by a medical professional, rather made by someone likes to code and found
      these exercises invaluable when dealing with undesirable emotional responses to normal situations. The 'solutions' are 
      not actual solutions, rather simple steps to be mindful of your emotions and react to situations more positively.
